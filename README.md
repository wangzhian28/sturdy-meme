Recruitment: Seeking Blockchain Developers to Join the Zhian Coin Project and Promote Press Freedom
Project Background & Vision
In the current global landscape where press freedom faces many challenges, we believe that technological innovation can create new opportunities for press freedom. We are planning to launch a virtual currency called Zhian Coin (ZA), aimed at rewarding journalists and media professionals who contribute to press freedom, and empowering the community to drive social change.

Zhian Coin will not only be a cryptocurrency but also a symbol of global press freedom and transparency. Through smart contracts and blockchain technology, Zhian Coin will transparently and traceably reward those who contribute by exposing social injustices and advocating for press freedom.

Project Design

Total Supply of Zhian Coin: 1,000,000,000 ZA

Coin Distribution:

15% will be rewarded to the development team;
5% will be sold at $0.01 for operational costs of the website;
10% will be randomly airdropped to the first 10,000 registered users as a reward for helping expose the coin;
70% will be locked, with 10% unlocking each year for the next 7 years.
Reward Mechanism:

Each year, users will vote for journalists and media professionals who provide independent reports, expose social injustices, and support press freedom. The top vote-getters will receive an annual reward;
The 10% of ZA unlocked each year will be used to reward the top media professionals;
To prevent fraudulent voting, we will set limits on the number of votes per registered user per year to ensure fairness.
Future Outlook:

After 7 years, all ZA coins will be distributed. At that point, we will repurchase ZA coins using profits from the website, and the repurchased coins will be distributed as rewards to the top media professionals each year.
Looking for Partners
As the founder of this project, I am a young person with great ideals, but I lack the technical skills and initial budget. Therefore, I am seeking like-minded developers to join me and help bring this vision to life. We are looking for developers with the following skills:

Blockchain Developers: Responsible for developing and issuing the smart contract for Zhian Coin and ensuring the token's compliance and security;
Frontend Developers: Responsible for creating a user-friendly platform interface that supports voting and wallet functionality;
Backend Developers: Responsible for building the backend architecture of the website, ensuring user data security and efficient transactions;
Community & Project Managers: Help build the community, promote the project, and ensure its long-term development.
Collaboration & Resources

Remote Work: The team will work remotely, allowing developers from all around the world to join the project;
Limited Budget: The project does not have a budget in the early stages, but I am willing to provide a valuable domain name that I ownâ€”one associated with a famous media personality, which comes with significant traffic and brand recognition, helping with project promotion;
Potential Returns: If the project is successful, developers will be rewarded with ZA coins and will have the opportunity for long-term collaboration as the project grows.
